            <p class="col-sm-8 descriptiontext">I designed and developed a website for Bun Bun Bake Shop, a fictional bakery store. After iterating through multiple prototypes and conducting user testing in between them, I implemented the pages in HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. This project allowed me to learn and gain experience in front end web design.</p>

        <p class="bodytext">Bun Bun Bake Shop, a small (fictional) bakery in Pittsburgh, wants to expand its business to allow customers to order cinnamon rolls online and have them delivered. The cinnamon rolls come in six different flavors and for each flavor, customers should be able to select their glazing and amounts preferences. To design and implement the bakery's new website, I conducted competitive analysis on existing websites as well as established Bun Bun Bake Shop's brand identity before moving on to wireframing and developing the different pages.</p>

            <p class="bodytext">I began the project by conducting competitive analysis on other existing websites that allow for product purchasing. To get a feel of navigating through these websites, I tried looking for information, browsing products, and putting items into my cart. I looked at Prantl's Bakery, Magnolia Bakery, and Nordstrom.</p>

I made minor changes to my high-fidelity designs, incorporating the feedback I received.</p>
